            <p>A rose is a plant that is a member of the genus Rosa, which consists of some 100 species of perennial
                shrubs in the rose family. Many roses are cultivated for their beautiful flowers, which range in colour
                from white through various tones of yellow and pink to dark crimson and maroon.</p>
            <p>A rose hip is the rose plant’s fleshy, berrylike floral cup, or hypanthium. It contains the plant’s
                seeds, and it usually ranges from red to orange in colour. Many species, particularly the rugosa rose,
                produce edible rose hips, which are a rich source of vitamin C and are sometimes used in preserves.</p>
            <p>Rose bushes are in season from mid-spring to autumn. The plant goes dormant in the winter.Strictly
                speaking, roses do not have thorns. They have prickles. Both, however, have the same purpose: they are
                plant defense mechanisms. Scientists believe that roses have prickles in order to protect themselves
                from animals drawn to them by their fragrance.</p>
